BACKEND ASSESSMENT 1.2
Your Client is a Luxury Hotel. The management still employs manual processes to carry out day to day
activities. You have been commissioned to help the management perform better with technology solutions
choosing Desktop, Mobile, Tablet as their media.

● Which customer booked which room certain days and services consumed and how much he will
pay
The goal is to complete a working api for the Hotel Booking Api Application with workflow features based
on the states listed above.
You should consider workflow libraries like; stateless (https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless)
to achieve this task.
For example On successful BookedRoom and Check-Out states; email should be fired as additional
action on the client’s workflow defined in the implementation.
Sending of mails and background jobs in the application will be handled by the Hangfire library.
Your delivery should show via api call or endpoints the histories of each rooms and clients in the hotel
MongoDB Database, .Net Core 3.1 - 5.0 and json output compatible rest api.
